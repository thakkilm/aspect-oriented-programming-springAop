# aspect-oriented-programming-springAop

This project demonstrates the implementation of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) using Spring AOP.

## Overview

In this project, you will find examples and explanations of the following Spring AOP annotations:

- `@After`
- `@Before`
- `@Around`
- `@AfterThrowing`
- `@AfterReturning`

These annotations are commonly used in Spring AOP to intercept and perform actions before or after method execution.

## Features

### Execution Time Calculation

Additionally, this project includes a method to calculate the execution time of each method. This can be useful for profiling and performance optimization. The method execution time is measured using the `@Around` aspect, one of the key AOP annotations mentioned above.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and learn more about Spring AOP with practical code samples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the examples provided in the source code.
3. Run the project to see the AOP annotations in action.
4. Experiment and adapt the code to your specific use cases.
